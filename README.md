# Polarity MongoDB Integration

Polarity's MongoDB integration can search your MongoDB instance using a user provided search and return results via the Polarity Overlay Window or HUD.  

> Note that by default the MongoDB integration will receive ALL entity types.  It is important that you select the "Manage Integration Data" option and turn off entity types you do not want sent to your ES integration.

> This integration is currently under development.  Please contact support@polarity.io if you are interested in using it.
